# HassMic (The App)

This is the HassMic app, an Android application designed to run on devices
acting as Home Assistant voice assistant satellites.

It is meant to pair with the [HassMic
Integration](http://github.com/jeffc/hassmic-integration).

[**Latest dev commit APK**](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/jeffcooper-public-bucket/hassmic-artifacts/by-branch/hassmic-dev.apk) (no guarantee of functionality, takes about 10 minutes from commit time to availability)

It is currently in active development and probably has lots of bugs. Some
highlights:

-   Automatically starting on Android 12+ fails in an annoying way: the service
    auto-starts, but can't access the microphone. This is a security feature
    added to Android that I don't have a great solution for (no auto-start
    services can access the microphone unless they also start a UI).
-   There's not really a "UI" to speak of. Opening the app gives some diagnostic
    information and a single toggle switch. You **must** enable running in the
    background, since that's where all the work happens. If running in the
    background isn't enabled, the app does nothing.
